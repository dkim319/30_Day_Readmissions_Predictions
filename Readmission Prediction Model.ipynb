    "## Project Definition - Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospitals often use 30-day readmissions as a measure to evaluate the quality of care provided by the hospital.  The goal of this metric is the reduce the number of 30-day readmissions by as much as possible.  The idea is that 30-day readmissions can be reduced by providing the patient with the appropriate care and the proper instructions on care after discharge.  It is expected that some patients with a higher acuity (sicker) patients have a higher likelihood of being readmitted within 30 days, but reducing readmissions as much as possible results in less unnecessary hospital care and a better overall patient experience.  Governmental agencies such as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) produce a risk-adjusted rate that enables readmission rate comparison across different hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project uses the MIMIC-III database that contains deidentified patient data for critical care hospital visits to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.  In order to access the data, a request must be approved by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Definition - Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This goal is to create a prediction model that can identify admissions that will result in a non-elective readmission within 30 days of discharge.  The strategy solve this problem is the following:\n",
    "1. Load the MIMIC-III dataset into a PostgresSQL database\n",
    "2. ETL the admission data into a format for machine learning\n",
    "3. Train and test a classification model\n",
    "The final model is expected to be used for future hospital admissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Definition - Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is the primary evaluation metric that will be used for this project. A secondary evaluation metric is the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) score.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology - Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was loaded into a local PostgreSQL instance and the data was transformed for machine learning purposes.  These are the steps taken using SQL to generate the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Aggregated data at the admission level\n",
    "2. Added LOS, emergency hours, icu_stays, age based on the date time fields\n",
    "3. Added primary diagnosis and procedure\n",
    "4. Added primary and secondary diagnosis in another set\n",
    "5. Added the readmitted within 30 days flag\n",
    "6. Added the cancer patient flag"

One of the tasks that I would do is clean up the age to ensure that age is always populated.  Another potential task is to clean up the ICD-9 coding that can be used to map all codes.  For the diagnosis codes, there are CCS categories, which are groups of diagnosis codes that can be used to reduce the variables.\n",
